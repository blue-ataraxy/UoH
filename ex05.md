    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: Browser reloads the /notes page, which causes 3 more HTTP requests

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

	browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
	activate server
	server->>browser: the JSON string
	deactivate server

	Note right of browser: SPA-style website does not send the form data to the server. Instead, it uses JS code fetched from the server. The JS code determines that the form data is to be sent with HTTP POST and data type is to be JSON.

FIRST, LOADING THE WEB PAGE

1. HTTP GET: html file
2. HTTP GET: css, js, json

THEN, HTTP POST

1. HTTP POST: /new_note_spa =>
   - Note: server responds to HTTP POST with status code 201 instead of 302. hence, it does not execute URL-redirect, and instead stays on the same page.

? Single-page application (SPA)

- traditional webpage: all of the logic is on the server, and the browser only renders the HTML as instructed
- SPA-style websites: they don't fetch their pages separately from the server. they comprise of only one HTML page fetched from the server, then the browser manipulates the contents of the page using JavaScript.
